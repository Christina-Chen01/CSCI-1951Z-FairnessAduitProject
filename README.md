### Jupyter Notebook Running Instructions

Our preprocessing code is divided into two parts to accommodate two different models; however, the main evaluation code is shared between them. 
**After completing the common preprocessing steps, it is crucial to execute the model-specific chunks—either for the resume scorer model or the candidate evaluator model—depending on which one is being used.** 
This ensures that each model processes the data appropriately and functions as intended within the shared evaluation framework.
